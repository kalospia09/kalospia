CBSE Science Notes Chapter 1 Chemical Reaction and Equation Notes
Below are some notes on CBSE Science, Chapter 1: "Chemical Reactions and Equations."
Chemical Reactions and Equations
1. Introduction:
A chemical reaction involves the transformation of one or more substances into new substances.
The substances before the reaction are called reactants, and the substances formed after the reaction are called products.
2. Chemical Equations:
A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction.
Reactants are written on the left side, and products are written on the right side of the arrow.
Example: 2H2?+O2??2H2?O
3. Balancing of Chemical Equations:
The number of atoms of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.
Coefficients are used to balance equations, but subscripts cannot be changed.
Example: CH4?+2O2??CO2?+2H2?O
4. Types of Chemical Reactions:
Combination Reactions:
Two or more substances combine to form a new substance.
Example: A + B ? AB
Decomposition Reactions:
A single substance breaks down into two or more simpler substances.
Example: AB ? A + B
Displacement Reactions:
One element is replaced by another element in a compound.
Example: A + BC ? AC + B
Redox Reactions:
Involves both oxidation (loss of electrons) and reduction (gain of electrons).
Example: Zn+2HCl?ZnCl2?+H2??
Double Displacement Reactions:
Exchange of ions between two compounds.
Example: AB + CD ? AD + CB
CBSE Books for Class 10
CBSE Class 10th Science Book	CBSE Class 10th Social Studies Book
CBSE Class 10th English Book	CBSE Class 10th Mathematics Book5. Effects of Chemical Reactions:
Evolution of Gas:
Production of gas during a reaction.
Example: Zn+2HCl?ZnCl2?+H2?
Formation of Precipitate:
Insoluble solid formed during a reaction.
Example: AgNO3?+NaCl?AgCl+NaNO3??
Change in Colour:
Change in the color of substances involved.
Example: FeSO4?+H2?S?FeS+H2?SO4?
Change in Temperature:
Absorption or release of heat.
Example: H2?O+CaO?Ca(OH)2?+Heat
6. Chemical Equations and Stoichiometry:
Stoichiometry involves the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions.
The mole concept is used for these calculations.
7. Chemical Equation and Types of Reactions - Elaboration:
Combination Reactions:
Involve the joining of two or more substances to form a new compound.
General form: A + B ? AB
Example: 2Na+Cl2??2NaCl
Decomposition Reactions:
Involve the breakdown of a compound into simpler substances.
General form: AB ? A + B
Example: 2H2?O2??2H2?O+O2?
Displacement Reactions:
Occur when one element displaces another from a compound.
General form: A + BC ? AC + B
Example: Zn + CuSO 4?? ZnSO 4?+ Cu
Redox Reactions:
Involve simultaneous oxidation and reduction reactions.
Example: 2Mg+O2??2MgO
Double Displacement Reactions:
Involve the exchange of ions between two compounds.
General form: AB + CD ? AD + CB
Example: NaCl+AgNO3??AgCl+NaNO3?
8. Balancing Chemical Equations - Tips:
Start by balancing the most complex molecules and then the simpler ones.
Use coefficients to balance the number of atoms on both sides.
Ensure that the same number of each type of atom is present on both sides.
9. Practical Applications:
Understanding chemical reactions is crucial in various industries, such as the production of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and food processing.
Environmental processes, like the breakdown of pollutants, are also governed by chemical reactions.
10. Importance of Stoichiometry:
Stoichiometry helps in determining the quantity of reactants and products in a chemical reaction.
It is essential for designing efficient industrial processes.
11. Exothermic Reaction: An exothermic reaction is characterized by the release of energy during the course of the reaction. Most commonly observed in decomposition reactions, these processes liberate energy in various forms. Example: In the process of respiration, a decomposition reaction takes place, and as a result, energy is released. Another example is the addition of quicklime (CaO) to water, where energy is released. Endothermic Reaction Conversely, an endothermic reaction is defined by the absorption of heat energy during the chemical transformation. Example: The decomposition of calcium carbonate is an instance of an endothermic reaction. In this process, heat energy is absorbed rather than released. 12. Real-life Examples:
Photosynthesis:
6CO2?+6H2?O+Light?C6?H12?O6?+6O2?
The process by which plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose using sunlight.
Respiration:
C6?H12?O6?+6O2??6CO2?+6H2?O
The reverse process of photosynthesis, occurring in cells to release energy.
Rusting of Iron:
4Fe+3O2?+6H2?O?4Fe(OH)3?
Iron reacts with oxygen and water to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, commonly known as rust.
Chemical reactions and equations are fundamental concepts in chemistry. Understanding these concepts is crucial for a deeper comprehension of various natural and industrial processes.
